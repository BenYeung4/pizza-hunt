## Description


In this project, Pizza Hunt, a social media recipe app where users can post their creative spins on pizza, add comments to recipes, and create threads within comments. To do this, you’ll add back-end functionality to an existing front end.

Instead of using a MySQL database, we use MongoDB, a document-based NoSQL database, and Mongoose, an Object-Document Mapper, to work with unstructured data. We will start our Progressive Web Application, or PWA. PWAs save data locally when there’s no internet connection by using IndexedDB, a NoSQL client-side storage API in the browser.

## Focus

With the use of NoSQL, databases allow you to easily store and retrieve unstructured data, which can significantly improve performance for some applications—especially those that use a lot of data.

With the use of MongoDB, popular NoSQL database, to store data using documents in the BSON format, which is a JSON-like object. MongoDB is part of the MERN stack (MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js)

Using Mongoose, an Object-Document Mapper (ODM), to map MongoDB’s document representations of data to a virtual object database. This uses an object-oriented approach, similar to the way an ORM maps relational representations of data to objects.

Finally, first step towards Progressive Web Application, or PWA. PWAs are web applications that act and feel like true mobile apps. To do this, you’ll use IndexedDB, a NoSQL client-side storage API in the browser, to save data locally to the browser when there’s no internet connection.
